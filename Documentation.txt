Overview :- 
This document provides an overview of the user authentication system implemented with registration, login, and JWT (JSON Web Token) generation functionalities. 
The system aims to ensure secure user management, following best practices in password storage, token handling, cookie usage, and input sanitization. 
The design principles ensure the system is well-structured, scalable, and maintainable.

Functionality

Registration :- 
The registration component allows users to create a new account. 
The form includes fields for name, email, password, and confirm password. 
The input is sanitized to prevent XSS attacks. Validation checks ensure: 

1. Name contains only letters and spaces.
2. Email is a valid Gmail address.
3. Password meets complexity requirements (8-15 characters, includes numbers, uppercase, lowercase, and special characters).
4. Password and confirm password match.

Login
The login component enables users to authenticate using their email and password. 
Successful login generates a JWT token stored in local storage for session management. 
Token handling is done securely to protect user data and sessions.

JWT Generation
On successful login, a JWT token is generated and returned to the client. 
The token is used for authenticating subsequent requests to protected endpoints. 
The token contains user information and an expiration time to 1 hr ensure it is valid only for a limited period.

After successful login
User are able to show name and email & update your name, email and password those routes are the secure route user only access after login.

Code Quality
Structure :-
The code is organized into logical components and functions, ensuring readability and maintainability. 
Each component has a clear responsibility, following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

Readability :-
Variable and function names are descriptive, following naming conventions and coding standards. 
Comments are used where necessary to explain complex logic.

Maintainability :-
The code follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, avoiding redundancy by reusing functions and components where applicable. 
The system is designed to be easily extensible for future enhancements.

Security
Password Storage :- 
Passwords are hashed using a secure hashing algorithm before storing in the database. Plain-text passwords are never stored.

Token Handling :- 
JWT tokens are generated using a secret key and include expiration times. Tokens are stored securely in local storage and included in the authorization header for authenticated requests.

Input Sanitization :- 
DOMPurify is used to sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks. Validation checks are implemented to ensure inputs meet the required criteria.

Cookie Usage :- 
Sensitive information is not stored in cookies. JWT tokens are handled in local storage to manage user sessions securely.

Design
Architecture :- 
The system follows a modular design, separating concerns into different components (e.g., registration, login, profile).
The architecture ensures scalability and ease of maintenance.

Scalability :-
The system is designed to handle increased load by modularizing components and using best practices in API design. 
Adding new features or scaling the existing ones can be done with minimal impact on the existing codebase.

Error Handling
Registration Errors :-
Errors during registration (e.g., user already exists) are handled gracefully, providing clear feedback to the user. 
Appropriate HTTP status codes and messages are returned from the backend.

Login Errors :-
Invalid login attempts (e.g., Invalid login Credentials, User not exist) are managed with clear error messages to inform the user. 
Failed attempts are logged for monitoring and potential security analysis.

API Errors :-
API calls handle errors using try-catch blocks, and meaningful error messages are returned to the client. 
This ensures users are informed of issues and appropriate actions can be taken.

Documentation
Approach

Modular Design: Components are designed to be reusable and independent, facilitating maintenance and scalability.

Secure Practices: Input sanitization, password hashing, and secure token handling ensure the system is robust against common security threats.

Validation: Comprehensive validation checks ensure data integrity and prevent invalid data from entering the system.

User Experience: The system provides clear feedback to users, ensuring a smooth and intuitive interaction.

Design Choices

DOMPurify for Sanitization: Chosen for its effectiveness in preventing XSS attacks by sanitizing user input.

JWT for Session Management: Provides a secure way to manage user sessions with stateless authentication.

Chakra UI for Components: Ensures a consistent and responsive user interface, enhancing the overall user experience.

Usage

Registration: Users fill in the registration form with the required details. Validation checks are performed, and sanitized data is sent to the backend.

Login: Users enter their email and password. On successful authentication, a JWT token is generated and stored in local storage.

Profile Management: Authenticated users can view and edit their profile details. Changes are validated, and sanitized data is sent to the backend.
